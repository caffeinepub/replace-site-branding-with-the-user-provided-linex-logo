  "summary": "REQ-1 updates the two logo image src URLs, but the diff refactors the banner to render only two logos via a new `brands` array/map and adds other attribute changes, which may violate the requirement/non-goal to change only the two specified <img> elements without altering other logos/structure.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Apply changes only to the two selected logo <img> elements in the BrandsBanner without changing any other images/logos (including number/order of logos).",
      "reason": "The diff replaces the banner rendering with a `brands` array containing exactly two items and maps over it, which appears to remove any other logos that may have existed previously and changes the DOM structure beyond only updating the two specified <img> elements.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "No other images/logos on the page are changed; banner layout and existing styling remain intact.",
      "reason": "Although the same wrapper classes are present, the implementation changes the rendering approach and adds new attributes (`loading=\"lazy\"`, different `alt` values), which indicates changes beyond only updating `src` on the two specified elements.",
