  "summary": "The diff only modifies `project_state.json` (project metadata) and does not show any frontend code/config or static asset changes required to replace the header logo image. It also introduces/records a branding feature that includes adding the logo to the footer, which conflicts with the BuildRequest non-goals.",

      "requirement": "Update the header logo <img> element (XPath: /html/body/div/div/header/div/a/img) so it always renders the user-provided Linex Automation logo served from `/assets/generated/linex-logo-user.dim_512x512.png` and does not display `/assets/generated/linex-logo.dim_512x512.png`.",
      "reason": "No changes are shown to `frontend/src/components/layout/SiteHeader.tsx`, `frontend/src/config/branding.ts`, or the static asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`. Only `project_state.json` was modified.",
