  "summary": "The diff partially implements the frontend-only static bootstrap (new main.static.tsx and index.html update) and adds an SPA redirect file plus converts the Contact form to a local-only submission flow. However, it does not remove/separate the Internet Computer backend from the build/deploy flow (backend changes were made and a new Motoko file was added), does not add Netlify build configuration (netlify.toml), and appears to introduce multiple UI/content changes that conflict with the “UI unchanged” requirement.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-50",
      "requirement": "Convert the project into a frontend-only, fully static React/Vite site suitable for Netlify deployment by removing the Internet Computer backend canister code and IC-specific build/deploy configuration from the repo.",
      "reason": "The diff still contains and modifies backend Motoko canister code, and even adds a new backend migration file, which contradicts removing/separating the backend from the build/deploy flow. No evidence is shown that dfx/IC deploy configuration was removed or separated for Netlify-only builds.",

      "requirement": "Remove Internet Identity and backend actor usage from the runtime (no II login flow needed; no actor required for pages to load).",
      "reason": "While the entrypoint is switched to a new static bootstrap file, the diff summary does not provide evidence that Internet Identity hooks/actor usage is fully removed from runtime across the app (it only shows useQueries.ts emptied). Immutable II/actor hook files are not shown and other call sites are not shown.",
