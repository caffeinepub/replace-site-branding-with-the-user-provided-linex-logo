  "summary": "REQ-44 typing/backspace behavior is implemented in HomePage.tsx, but the diff also introduces broader component-level changes (new state/effect logic and imports) despite the constraint to apply changes ONLY to the selected span. Additionally, an extra pulsing cursor element was added inside the span, which was not explicitly requested.",
