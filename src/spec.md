# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the specified heading text to “About Us” and ensure the “Industry 4.0” solution appears on the Solutions page.

**Planned changes:**
- Update only the targeted heading span (specified by the provided XPath) to render the exact text: “About Us”.
- Add an “Industry 4.0” solution card to `/solutions`, matching the existing Solutions card design and using the same content as the Home page “Our Solutions” Industry 4.0 item.
- Ensure the “Industry 4.0” card appears as the last item in the Solutions grid under default filters.

**User-visible outcome:** The selected page heading shows “About Us”, and the Solutions page includes an “Industry 4.0” card at the end of the list that matches the Home page version.
