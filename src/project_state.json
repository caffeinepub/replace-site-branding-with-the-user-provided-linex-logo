  "summary": "Project scope changed: convert the existing Internet Computer (Motoko + React) app into a frontend-only, fully static React/Vite site suitable for deployment on Netlify, removing all backend/canister code and Internet Identity integration while keeping the visible frontend UI unchanged.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend uses React + Vite with Tailwind styling and a shared SiteLayout (header/footer).",
    "Authentication flow relies on Internet Identity; frontend constructs authenticated canister actors via hooks.",
    "Backend is a Motoko canister with reusable authorization/access-control modules.",
    "Build/deploy scaffolding includes dockerized and ICP CLI-oriented templates plus image resize/prune scripts.",
    "Services icon mapping decision: Element 1 = Servo (use new gear icon); Element 2 = Energy Management (use lightning symbol).",
    "Home page hero media should be implemented as a high-quality, creative slideshow (not an auto-marquee): infinite seamless loop, autoplay, supports manual swipe/drag and clickable bottom navigation (creative rounded bars/dots), cycling through the original hero image plus additional industrial/PLC/Schneider EMS/Siemens automation/servos/VFD images.",
    "Hero slideshow navigation: small round white dots, interactive (click/tap) and compatible with infinite looping; one dot per slide.",
    "Hero slideshow content: one unique high-quality real-world photo per slide; do not duplicate images across slides.",
    "Hero slideshow change request: remove the 5th slide (image '2' position in reordered sequence 3,7,5,6,2,1,4) entirely and append a new final slide using the newly uploaded image (image-14.png), increasing slide count by one.",
    "New hero slideshow change request: remove the current last slide and append a new final slide using the user-provided image from https://ibb.co/4Rth5D8p."

  "known_issues": [
    "Reported issue: user-provided logo/branding was not updated or reflected in the deployed site.",
    "Deployed site is still showing the wrong logo; user requests removing the current logo and using the previously shared Linex Automation logo instead.",
    "Home hero slideshow is still using the wrong/old photos; user requests replacing them with the photos they shared earlier.",
    "Home hero slideshow navigation dots are too bright and too close together (crowded); needs softer color and increased spacing.",
    "Deployment used an incorrect/random \"Ironman\" image in the Home hero slideshow instead of the user-attached engineering-layout photo; must replace the same slide as before (the slide corresponding to image '2' / 5th position in reordered sequence 3,7,5,6,2,1,4) with the newly attached image, keeping slide count unchanged.",
    "User reports the incorrect deployment consumed 2 credits.",
    "Deployed Home hero slideshow slide is still using a random/incorrect laptop photo (darker background with a face reflection) instead of the user-uploaded laptop-with-schematics image (referred to as image-12.png); needs replacement in the intended slide position.",
    "Mobile menu issue: the close (X) button overlaps the Home button; shift the four menu buttons (Home/About/Solutions/Contact) slightly downward without moving the X button.",
    "User requests changing hero slideshow structure: delete the previously replaced 5th slide (in reordered sequence 3,7,5,6,2,1,4) and add the new uploaded image (image-14.png) as the last slide; then rebuild/deploy.",
    "Project storage limit exceeded when user attempts to upload the original photo asset for the hero slideshow (blocks using the exact user-provided last-slide image)."
