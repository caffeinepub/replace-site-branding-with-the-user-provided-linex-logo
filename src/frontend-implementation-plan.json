      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On the Home page, the selected `<span>` in the hero `<h1>` displays a typing animation for the word \"Planning\", then deletes the full word via a backspace effect, then types \"Precision\", deletes it, then types \"Performance\", deletes it, and repeats from \"Planning\" indefinitely.",
        "Only the selected span’s text content/behavior is changed; its existing Tailwind class(es) (including its color class) remain unchanged and the visual font/color do not change.",
        "The animation runs smoothly on both desktop and mobile and does not cause layout breakage or clipping in the hero headline."

          "description": "Update only the hero headline span currently rendering \"Excellence\" to instead render a state-driven animated string. Implement in-file typing/backspace logic (e.g., React state + effect with timed updates) that cycles through [\"Planning\",\"Precision\",\"Performance\"], types each word character-by-character, deletes the full word character-by-character, and loops indefinitely. Keep the span’s existing Tailwind classes unchanged and avoid any styling changes elsewhere in the page."
